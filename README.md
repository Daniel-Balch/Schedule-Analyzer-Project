This was my team's term project for the course CSE 201 (Introduction to Software Engineering) at Miami University. We were given an existing program that was developed by a different team who had taken the class in a previous semester. The program we were given only helped students find final exam schedule conflicts for courses. 

Our overall goal was to expand upon the program by adding the ability to find regular course schedule conflicts, a wizard to help students plan their course schedule, and a feature that automatically prevents a student from being able to add courses that he/she isn't eligible to take (due to prerequisites requirements) or that have time conflicts (not final exam times) with other courses already added to the schedule being built. We also decided to add more functionality by allowing the program to export results so that a student can quit the program and come back later to continue working on his/her schedule, expanding its ability to import course/requirements information and student course history from .csv files, and adding a feature where it finds and shows the shortest walking paths between classes (along with an estimate of the walking times). I personally developed the back-end for the aforementioned feature; all other features were developed and integrated under my supervision as team leader.
